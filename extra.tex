{\small These problems are hard and interesting. The solutions should \\
be presents orally before April 14. It might improve your score,\\
but should be used for fun. Only the first solution will be graded.}

\ 


\noi $1$. Construct a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $\RR$ such that a function $f\:\RR\to\RR$ is nondecreasing if and only if it is continuous for the topology $\mathcal{T}$.

\ 


\noi $2$. 
Find three disjoint open sets in the real line 
which have the same nonempty boundary. 

\ 

\noi $3$. How many pairwise distinct sets can one obtain
from of a single set by using the operators closure and interior?

\ 

\noi $4$. Construct a continuous function 
$f\:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f$ takes every value in $[0,1]$ 
an infinite number of times.

\ 

\noi $5$. Describe all the homeomorphisms from the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle}{Sierpinski triangle} to it self.

\ 

\noi $6$. Prove that $\RR^3\backslash S^1$ is homeomorphic to $\RR^3\backslash (\ell\cup \{p\})$, where $\ell$ is a straight line and $p\not\in\ell$ is a point in $\RR^3$.


\ 


\noi $7.$ Show that any nonempty open star-shaped set in $\RR^2$ is homeomorphic to the open disc.

\ 


\noi $8.$ Construct two functions $\RR\to\RR$, one is closed but not continuous, and the other is open but not continuous.

\ 

\noi $9.$
Construct a bounded open set $\Omega$ in $\RR^2$
such that its boundary $\partial \Omega$ is totally path-diconnected;
that is, no pair of distinct points $x,y\in\partial \Omega$ can be connected by a path in $\partial \Omega$.

\ 

\noi $10.$ Show that any connected finite space is path connected.

\ 

\noi $11.$ Let $X$ be a path connected space, consider space 
$$Z=X\times X/\sim,$$
where $(x,y)\sim(y,x)$.
Prove that $\pi_1(Z)$ is abelian.

\ 

\noi $12.$ Prove that any two spaces with the same homotopy type 
can be embedded as
deformation retracts in the same topological space.

\end{document}


\ 

\noi $7$. Find two compact subsets $A,B\i\RR^2$ such that 
$A$ is not homeomorphic to $B$ but $A\times[0,1]$ is homeomorphic to $B\times[0,1]$.


\ 

\noi $4$. Prove that the set of rational numbers 
$\QQ$ is not an intersection of a countable collection of open sets in $\RR$.




\ 

\noi $12.$ Let $X$ be a topological space, $U, V \subset  X$ two open subsets. 
Prove that if
$U \cup V$ and $U \cap V$ are simply connected, then so are $U$ and $V$.


\ 

\noi $13.$ Let a topological space $X$ be the union of two open path-connected
sets $U$ and $V$. 
Prove that if $U\cap V$ has at least three connected components,
then the fundamental group of $X$ is non-Abelian.

\ 

\noi %\sout{$14.$} \textit{(solved)} 
$14.$ Construct two covering maps $f\:X\to Y$ and $g\:Y\to Z$ such that the compositions $gf\:X\to Z$ is not a covering.

\ 

\noi $15.$ Construct a finite topological space with fundamental group isomorphic to $\ZZ_2$.
