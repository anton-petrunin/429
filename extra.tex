{\small These problems are hard and interesting.
The solutions should \\
be presents orally before April 16.
It might improve your score,\\
but should be used for fun. Only the first solution will be graded.}

\noi 0. Find a mistake or misprint in the \href{https://anton-petrunin.github.io/topology/book.pdf}{lecture notes}.
(The score depends on the type of mistake.)

\

that have the same nonempty boundary. 

\ 

\noi \sout{$2$.} \textit{(solved)} Construct a continuous function 
$f\:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f$ takes every value in $[0,1]$ 
an infinite number of times.

\ 

\noi \sout{$10.$} \textit{(solved)} Let $K$ be a compact space.
